# AI-Enabled Phishing Detection Model

## Overview
Phishing attacks continue to be a significant threat to cybersecurity, posing risks to individuals, businesses, and organizations worldwide. To address this challenge, I developed an AI-enabled phishing detection model using ensemble learning techniques.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a robust and accurate system capable of identifying phishing websites with high precision and recall. By leveraging ensemble learning, we aim to combine multiple base classifiers to improve the overall performance and reliability of the detection model.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
We collected a diverse dataset comprising features extracted from both legitimate and phishing websites. The dataset includes various indicators such as URL length, domain age, presence of HTTPS, and content-based features.

### Preprocessing
Before training the model, we conducted extensive preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables. Additionally, we performed feature selection to identify the most informative attributes for training.

### Ensemble Learning
Ensemble learning techniques, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost, were employed to build multiple base classifiers. Each classifier was trained on a subset of the data or with different feature subsets to introduce diversity and reduce overfitting.

### Model Evaluation
We evaluated the performance of each base classifier using cross-validation and selected the best-performing models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Subsequently, we combined the individual classifiers into an ensemble model using techniques such as bagging or boosting.

## Results
The ensemble phishing detection model demonstrated superior performance compared to individual classifiers, achieving high accuracy and robustness against various types of phishing attacks. By leveraging the strengths of multiple classifiers, our model effectively identifies suspicious websites while minimizing false positives.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of real-time data feeds for dynamic updating of the model.
- Exploration of advanced ensemble techniques and model architectures for further performance improvement.
- Deployment of the model as a web service or browser extension for widespread use and accessibility.
